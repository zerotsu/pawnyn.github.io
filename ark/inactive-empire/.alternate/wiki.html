			<h1 class="article-header">Introduction</h1>
			<p>Right, uh, basically... Inactive Empire is a sad attempt to become another “Cerberus” <small>(prev. owned by <a href="#">Kargos</a>)</small>. While most of its members are aware of the fact that they will never become as strong, powerful, and—of course—good-looking as Cerbus' old leader, <a href="#">Kargos</a>.</p>
		
			<p>For those who are new to the tribe and did not have the privilege to be a part of Cerberus, here’s a quick breakdown of what happened: <a href="#">Cerberus Trivia</a></p>

			<p>Tags: <span class="first tag red">NEWS</span><span class="last tag gray">CERBERUS</span></p>
		
			<h1 class="article-header">What do I do here?</h1>
			<p>In Inactive Empire, you are (almost) free to do whatever you want. Our main goal is to have fun at playing the game. Expanding, raiding, PVP, boss fights, etc. are, of course, things we plan on doing as well. If you feel like you need to take a break from all the farming, that’s totally fine. Everybody needs a little time for themselves at some point. If you plan to spend your time off with raiding smaller bases, we’s appreciate if you’d:
			<ul>
				<li>farm the resources in advance</li>
				<li>make sure that no dinos die <small>(for safety and stat reasons)</small></li>
				<li>look for people who can assist you in case something goes wrong</li>
				<li>content here</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		
			<h1 class="article-header">Breeding</h1>
			<p>Tribes that want to make it far have to start with breeding at some point. While breeding, it's important that the generations and lines stay consistent. That means that other players are not allowed to mess with lines that have been assigned to other tribe members. If you need a tame to imprint and call your own, reach out to the person in charge of the lines. A full list of breeders can be found on Discord.</p>
		
			<p>Furthermore, we ask you to please keep the tribe updated about your breeding activity. If you are stuck with a line, do no longer with to work on it, or just want to update everybody about X dino, just let us know.</p>
		
			<h1 class="article-header">Farming</h1>
			<p>Farming is what keeps the tribe running. Sure, farming might not always be the most fun thing to do, but it’s necessary. Other than breeding, farming is not limited to a certain rank or a certain player. If you feel like we are missing a resource or you just want to make sure we have enough, call get yourself a mate, some dinos, and head out there to farm.</p>

			<h1 class="article-header">Building</h1>
			<p>Building, as fun as it seems, requires a lot of practice to be <i>good</i>. Inactive Empire has a special role to distinguish builders from regular players. It's their job to maintain the base and expand it if necessary. Please do <span style="color: red;">not</span> build on your own.</p>

			<p>If you think your skills in building are a good addition to the tribe, feel free to contact one of the Builders/Tribe admins and ask for a position.</p>

			<h1 class="article-header">Discord</h1>
			<p>Discord is our main tool for communication. All members of the tribe should be a member of the Discord server as well since it serves as an expanded wiki about upcoming projects, plans, task lists, and more. In addition to that, it's also used to ask for help when a raid is taking place – be it with attacking or defending.</p>
